>The goal of this homework assignment is to introduce you to R, Posit, and Quartio, which you'll be using throughout the course both to learn the data science concepts discussed in the course and to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions.

# Learning outcome

- Back to use R
- Introduction to Posit
- Introduction to Quarto

# Getting started

## Prerequisites

This assignment assumes that you have reviewed the lectures titled "02-Meet the toolkit". If you haven't yet done so, please pause and complete the following before continuing.

## Terminology

We've already thrown around a few new terms, so let's define them before we proceed.

-   **R:** Name of the programming language we will be using throughout the course.

-   **Posit:** An integrated development environment for R. In other words, a convenient interface for writing and running R code.

## Starting slow

As the course progresses, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the assignments dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better analyst! Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. First, we will explore the fundamental building blocks of all of these tools.

Before you can get started with the analysis, you need to make sure you:

-   are a member of the course Posit Cloud space (See Canvas Announcements for details)

If you failed to confirm any of these, it means you have not yet completed the prerequisites for this assignment. Please go back to [Prerequisites] and complete them before continuing the assignment.
